## About me

My name is Angelika Kryska. I graduated from the Cracow University of Economics. Recently, I was employed in the Quality Management Department in one of Krakow's banks. I am currently in the process of changing my career path. I would like to become a software tester. I believe that my previous professional experience and willingness to learn and continuous development will allow me to spread my wings in the IT industry. I have experience in individual work and teamwork. I am open to changes and any news. I present my technical skills that I gained during the completed challenge / course and through self-study.
